=======

Built using 3js and webpack. 

=======

Do use any music you like - as it won't run otherwise - saved as spacemusic.mp3, prefer(r)ably ambient space music from youtube. 

=======

Used three-globe library built by vasturiano and implemented it further. Used nearest neighbor algorithm and calculated the optimal path to all the country capitals - all written BY HAND in a json file of each countries' capital, latitude and longitude - and visualized the paths between them as arcs. 

=======

Random stars set in the background with random timed shooting stars around. 

=======

Definitely looking forward to adding more functionalities later to make it a full fledged real-time project.

=======

The country outlines may not be accurate as they were taken based off a .json file. To get them to be more accurate, would have to pinpoint their (lat,lon) accurately and map them. The arc may jump to a point in the ocean, it most likely is an island country that exists but not represented for the same reason.
